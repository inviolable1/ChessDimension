	Need to create a model too, to access database for this. model will be responsible for putting in validated data into the database. Can put a default move 0 FEN/ starting position in the database, so we always have a basis to get previous data
	
	Note: What if someone hacks javascript, and changes position of many pieces? how will my valiator/database cope with it? How will it know what move was carried out? or can they do this in the first place? if they're only limited to changing rules in JS to allow them to make special moves, this validator will catch them out.
	
	Need to add a function- if JAVASCRIPT validates OK, but this validates NOT OK, kick the person because he is obviously cheating. Close game, award win to the opponent.
	
	NOTE: ORDER MATTERS!
